# BeastBot
<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/build-development-yellow" />
BeastBot is a [Discord](https://discord.com/) bot for our gym group. It is currently a work in progress.

# Getting started
This will be complete for version 1.0. At the very least, you will need [Discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and other libraries specified in requirements.txt. You will also need to download some data:

```
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('wordnet')
nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')
```
